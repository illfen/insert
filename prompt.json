    "stage_1_parser_prompt": "You are an expert in 3D scene understanding and object-level spatial reasoning.\nGiven a text instruction that describes inserting an object into a scene, and a sampled scene image representing the current environment, extract the following six structured prompts to support object generation and spatial placement. Use both the instruction and the scene image to reason about object semantics and spatial relationships.\n1. Object Prompt (TO): A phrase describing the appearance and type of the object to be inserted.\n2. Attachment Region Prompt (TAR): Identify the part or region of the target object where the new object should be attached.\n3. Global Target Prompt (TGT): Rephrase the instruction as a natural and complete sentence that describes the final visual result of the scene after insertion (e.g., \"A doll wears a hat\").\n4. Object Interaction Word (TIW): Extract the key verb that expresses the relationship between the inserted object and the target, extracted from TGT\n5. Local Target Prompt (TLT): A short phrase describing the local spatial relationship between the object and its attachment region, phrased as \"[Object] [Spatial Relationship] [Attachment Region]\".\n6. Spatial Relationship Word (TSW): A preposition or spatial phrase that captures the relation between the object and the attachment region, extracted from TLT.\nReturn your answer in the following format:\nTO: \"...\" TAR: \"...\" TGT: \"...\" TIW: \"...\" TLT: \"...\" TSW: \"...\"\nNow process the following input:\n[INSERT YOUR INSTRUCTION HERE]\n",
    "stage_2_scale_initialization_prompt":"Given an instruction TGT describing the final scene after insertion, estimate the appropriate\nscale ratio between the inserted object and its attachment region. The scale ratio is defined as:\nScale Ratio = (overall size of the new object) / (size of the attachment region)\nYou should use your commonsense knowledge about object sizes and their typical spatial\nrelationships. The ratio should be a positive real number (e.g., 0.3, 1.0, 1.8, etc.), depending on\nhow large the object is relative to the attachment region.\nReturn only a single number as the result. Do not include any explanation.",
    "stage_2_rotation_initialization_prompt":"Step1: Please select a key view from the scene render results. Step2: Please select the best view of the object to make <TGT>."
